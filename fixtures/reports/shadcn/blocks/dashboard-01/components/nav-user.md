| Line | Severity | Code | Construct | Reason | Suggested fix |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 46 | warning | `class/web-only` | `data-[state=open]:bg-sidebar-accent data-[state=open]:text-sidebar-accent-foreground` | `data-*` attribute selectors are web-only, so this style does not apply on native. | Drive the style from a prop or state instead (e.g. a styled() variant). |
| 48 | warning | `class/web-only` | `grayscale` | Filters are dropped on native. |  |
| 52 | warning | `class/web-only` | `grid` | CSS grid is not available on native; grid classes are dropped there. | Use flex rows/columns (or `web:grid native:flex`) for layouts that must match on native. |
| 53 | warning | `class/web-only` | `truncate` | `truncate` sets text-overflow and white-space, which native drops. | Use `line-clamp-1` for single-line truncation on native. |
| 56 | warning | `class/web-only` | `truncate` | `truncate` sets text-overflow and white-space, which native drops. | Use `line-clamp-1` for single-line truncation on native. |
| 64 | warning | `class/web-only` | `w-(--radix-dropdown-menu-trigger-width)` | CSS variables and functions other than `calc()`/`clamp()` do not resolve on native. | Use a token or a plain value (px, %, rem) that native can resolve. |
| 70 | info | `element/view` | `<div>` | Flex container converted to `View`; `flex-row` added because `View` is a column by default. |  |
| 75 | warning | `class/web-only` | `grid` | CSS grid is not available on native; grid classes are dropped there. | Use flex rows/columns (or `web:grid native:flex`) for layouts that must match on native. |
| 76 | warning | `class/web-only` | `truncate` | `truncate` sets text-overflow and white-space, which native drops. | Use `line-clamp-1` for single-line truncation on native. |
| 79 | warning | `class/web-only` | `truncate` | `truncate` sets text-overflow and white-space, which native drops. | Use `line-clamp-1` for single-line truncation on native. |
